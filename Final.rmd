# Introduction

A new  preventative vaccine (covid921) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups by gender( guys and gals), drug use, and sexual orientation. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine. Structure your report in four sections each devoted to one of the four subgroups, use null and alternative hypothesis statements and correct statistical verbage when referencing p-values in conclusions.

## Males

  

### Visual Results


```{r}
# Bar plot

# Summarize the data for Males by infection status and treatment
male_summary_data <- Male %>%
  group_by(infected, treatment) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(prcnt = count / sum(count))

# Bar plot for count of infected vs treatment
male_plot_count <- ggplot(male_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = count, fill = treatment))
male_plot_count + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Males Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Count of Infected Males") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "yellow", "vaccine" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot for percentage of infected vs treatment
male_plot_percent <- ggplot(male_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = prcnt * 100, fill = treatment))
male_plot_percent + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Males Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Percentage of Infected Males") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "yellow", "vaccine" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

These bar graphs show the number of males who got COVID. It's clear that males with the vaccine have fewer cases than those who took the placebo, but the numbers are pretty close. To get a clearer picture, we need to use a different type of graph.

### Numerical Results

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Male)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

The results show that out of the males who got COVID, 73.8% took the placebo, and 26.2% had the vaccine. For the males who stayed healthy, 50.01% took the placebo, and 49.99% had the vaccine. Overall, 2.82% of males who took the placebo got COVID, compared to only 1.02% of those who got the vaccine. This shows the vaccine helps lower the chances of getting COVID. The bar plots back up these results and show that the vaccine works to reduce infections in males.

### Inferential Results
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
Malefish <- fisher.test(table1)
Malefish
```

The main result comes from Fisher's Exact Test, which gave a super tiny p-value (𝑝=2.2×10⁻¹⁶). This means the difference in infection rates between the vaccine and placebo groups is almost definitely not random. Because of this, we reject the idea (the null hypothesis) that treatment doesn’t affect infection rates. The odds ratio, about 2.82, means males who got the vaccine were almost 2.8 times more likely to get COVID compared to those on the placebo. This suggests the vaccine didn’t work well to prevent COVID in males.


```{r}
male_effect <- Malefish$p.value / (Malefish$p.value + 1)
effectiveness_male <- (1 - 1 / Malefish$estimate) * 100
print(effectiveness_male)

male_low <- (1 - 1 / Malefish$conf.int[1]) * 100
male_hi <- (1 - 1 / Malefish$conf.int[2]) * 100
options(digits = 2)

male_low
male_hi
```

### `r effectiveness_male`% Effectiveness with Confidence Interval: `r male_low`%  to `r male_hi`%

The vaccine is over 50% effective for males, showing that it works. Its effectiveness is calculated at 64.48%, with a confidence range of 54.75% to 72.32%. This means we can confidently say the vaccine helps reduce COVID infections in males.  

The null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) said the vaccine doesn’t affect infection rates, while the alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)) said it does. Because of the very small p-value from Fisher's Exact Test and an odds ratio of 2.82, we reject the null hypothesis and accept that the vaccine does lower infection rates in males.  

The odds ratio means males who got the vaccine were almost 2.8 times more likely to avoid getting COVID than those who took the placebo. The confidence range (54.75% to 72.32%) backs this up, proving the vaccine is effective at protecting males from COVID.





## Females

### Summary of Females

```{r}
female_summary <- Female %>% 
  group_by(treatment, infected) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = infected, values_from = count, values_fill = 0) 
female_summary <- female_summary %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(select(., -treatment))) 
female_column_totals <- female_summary %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = "Total") 
female_summary <- bind_rows(female_summary, female_column_totals) 
female_summary 
```

There are 18,328 females in total. Out of these, 365 have COVID, and 17,963 are healthy. Only 237 of them got the placebo, which isn’t enough to see a clear pattern. Let’s add a bar graph to help us see this visually.

### Visual Results

```{r}
# Bar plot

# Summarize the data for Females by infection status and treatment
female_summary_data <- Female %>%
  group_by(infected, treatment) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(prcnt = count / sum(count))

# Bar plot for count of infected vs treatment
female_plot_count <- ggplot(female_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = count, fill = treatment))
female_plot_count + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Females Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Count of Infected Females") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "green", "vaccine" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot for percentage of infected vs treatment
female_plot_percent <- ggplot(female_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = prcnt * 100, fill = treatment))
female_plot_percent + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Females Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Percentage of Infected Females") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "green", "vaccine" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The bar graphs above show how many females got COVID-19. It looks like females who got the vaccine have fewer cases of COVID compared to those who got the placebo. However, the numbers for both groups are very similar in the graphs. Even though there seems to be a small difference, we need to do a statistical test to see if this difference is meaningful.

### Numerical Results

```{r}
table2 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Female)
rowPerc(table2)
colPerc(table2)
```

The numbers show that, among the females who got infected, 65% took the placebo, and 35% took the vaccine. For those who didn’t get infected, 50% took the placebo, and 50% took the vaccine. Overall, 2.6% of females on the placebo got COVID-19, compared to just 1.4% of those on the vaccine. This suggests the vaccine helps lower infection rates. These results back up the bar graphs, showing that the vaccine works to reduce COVID-19 rates in females.
